# Simple Client Server ![CI](https://github.com/JamesBoer/Scs/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

The Simple Client Server (SCS) library is a lightweight client/server framework designed to simplify the creation of simple TCP/IP based client-server applications in C++.  While there are many frameworks designed for more comprehensive or complex networking scenarios, the SCS library instead focuses on the minimum amount of code required to create small, lightweight client/server libraries or applications.

Building the library is simple.  Just drop the code in the /Source folder into your project, and include the Scs.h header file.  The SCS library should compile cleanly under Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux when using a modern C++ compiler (C++ 17 or better compliance).
